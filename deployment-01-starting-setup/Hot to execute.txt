 1) Create an instance in AWS
 ssh -i "example1pem.pem" ec2-user@ec2-51-20-126-80.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com

 2) In the next lecture, we'll install Docker on a virtual EC2 instance.

Please note that the following command (which is used in the next lecture) will unfortunately not work anymore:

amazon-linux-extras install docker
Instead, use this approach / these commands:

sudo yum update -y
sudo yum -y install docker
 
sudo service docker start
 
sudo usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
Make sure to log out + back in after running these commands.

Once you logged back in, run this command:

sudo systemctl enable docker
Thereafter, you can check whether Docker is available by running:

docker version

3) create repository in docker Hub
4) build image locally
docker build -t node-dep-example-1 .
5) push image to docker
docker tag node-dep-example-1 giohnny/node-example-1
6) docker push giohnny/node-example-1
7) Connect to AWS
ssh -i "example1pem.pem" ec2-user@ec2-16-16-24-244.eu-north-1.compute.amazonaws.com
7) in AWS execute
sudo docker run -d --rm -p 80:80 giohnny/node-example-1
8) To update the image from DockerHub
docker pull giohnny/node-example-1
